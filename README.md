# RuleEngine
This Rule Engine leverages the Common Expression Language (CEL) as a foundation to evaluate rules based on user-configurable parameters such as UECategory and UEQosFlows. This flexible approach allows for customization and adaptability in rule evaluation.
The core functionality of the engine is facilitated by the CEL framework, which efficiently matches rules against input data. When a rule matches, it triggers a corresponding user-defined action. These actions can take the form of scripts or modules, providing a versatile way to execute commands.
One of the standout features of the Rule Engine is its support for multiple programming languages, ensuring language independence. Whether developed in Go, C++, or other languages, the engine seamlessly integrates with various coding environments.
The engine also supports the use of common expressions, enabling users to create rule conditions using English language lambda expressions. This makes the process of defining rule criteria more intuitive and accessible.
Moreover, it enables easy mapping of actions to scripts or gRPC calls. This means that actions are not limited to predefined functions, they can encompass a wide range of operations. Whether it's executing scripts or invoking custom modules, the engine offers flexibility in defining actions.
Additionally, the engine allows for dynamic rule precedence configuration during runtime. This means that the priority of rules can be adjusted on the fly, accommodating changing requirements and scenarios.
In summary, Rule Engine delivers a robust and adaptable solution for evaluating rules using the power of Common Expression Language. It supports multiple programming languages, employs user-friendly expressions, and allows versatile action mappings. The engine's dynamic rule precedence further enhances its agility and suitability for a variety of applications.
